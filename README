SpaceGame - project
-------------------

SpaceGame is a simple 2d game.

The aim of this project is to learn to write a 2D game using C++, SDL2 and OpenGL. The original idea was to have a very simple architecture and concentrate on the game programming basics. However, In some point I was too unsatisfied with the complex and rigid code and decided to concentrate more on the architectural design. So, the project is divided in to two parts: the game engine library and the actual game. The game engine library (called Tile2D) provides some basic features such as GUI elements, sprites, dynamics, collision detection, path finding tools and some cross-cutting features such as events and (dependency)properties. The actual game (which might be quite simple) is going to be built on top of the Tile2D.
