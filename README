SpaceGame - project
-------------------

SpaceGame is a simple 2d game.

The aim of this project is to learn to write a simple 2D game using C++, SDL2 and OpenGL. I try to keep the structure of the code as simple as possible (less than 20 classes). The architecture is quite rigid, so the code may not be reusable. The focus is on the game programming basics (physics, rendering and so on), NOT on architectural design.

Okay, now the first phase (or sprint, whatever) is almost done. There is basic physics, collision detection and rendering implemented. I'm going to add some comments and documentation during the next few days. If you're willing to use the engine in your own project, you are warned: I'm C++ newbie, so there might be some bugs (memory leaks, for example). In addition, I have done no testing at all. That's because I've been too busy learning just some SDL2/OpenGL/physics/C++ basics. I might add tests in some point. Not sure how to test OpenGL though... Maybe there should be one more layer for that.

The second phase is done. Now artificial intelligence related things are ready. The AI is not very sophisticated, but good enough. The Brains and BrainCell classes are meant to be used for AI purposes. I used A* algorithm for path finding (see RouteGenerator.cpp).

I'm sorry that I haven't added any documentation yet. The core classes are still under heavy construction, so it's better to add the documentation later (i'm too lazy for updating the documentation all the time...).

Over the next two weeks I'm going to study some soundFX and music related stuff. I'll design and implement a simple music/soundFX player. Although the focus is primarily on programming I'm also going to compose some music.
