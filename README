- Custom 2D physics engine (rigid body dynamics, collision detection etc)
- Tilemap rendering and collision detection
- Particle systems
- Light system based on flood fill algorithm (similar to Terraria)
- Primitives like 2D vectors, rectangles and such
- Math helper functions (clamping, delta angle, etc)
- Efficient pathfinding algorithm (A*)
- Linecasting to find out if there is a tile in a tile map between two endpoints
