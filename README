SpaceGame - project
-------------------

SpaceGame is a 2D game that uses a custom 2D game engine (Tile2D). It is written in C++
using SDL2 and OpenGL.

This is a list of the main features of the game engine (Tile2D):

- Support for Windows and Mac OSX
- Unity3D-kind-of public interface (Scenes, GameObjects, Components, etc)
- Built-in easy-to-use components such as Sprite, Body, PolygonCollider, Light etc.
- Simple UI system (buttons, text)
- Simple event system for raising events and handling them
- Custom 2D physics engine (rigid body dynamics, collision detection etc)
- Tilemap rendering and collision detection
- Particle systems
- Light system based on flood fill algorithm (similar to Terraria)
- Primitives like 2D vectors, rectangles and such
- Math helper functions (clamping, delta angle, etc)
- Efficient pathfinding algorithm (A*)
- Linecasting to find out if there is a tile in a tile map between two endpoints

Note that the assets of the game are not included in this repository. You'll need to
download them separately.
